# 🌍 Language Learning Web App with Gamification & AI Integration

## 🚀 Overview

This web app helps users learn new languages—primarily Mandarin—by integrating an AI-powered chat assistant (DeepSeek) that acts as a translator and grammar helper. It also includes a gamified, team-based system where users can:

- Track daily language learning progress 📊
- Earn rewards 🎁
- Compete with others 🏆

Blockchain technology (via ThirdWeb) is used to issue NFTs as rewards for consistent progress. 🎮🎓
